Black Pearl Origin is a fork of the Project Black Pearl, founded and maintained by the former PBP lead developers. It was forked due to a fallout with one of the owners in PBP.

## What is Black Pearl Origin?

**Black Pearl Origin** (or BPO) is a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) project that aims to unify game sources in one place by utilizing extensions made by the community. It is aimed to provide a convenient way of dealing with games sourced from all sorts of websites and provides a store system powered by a powerful extension ecosystem.
